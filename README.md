# Notebooks used to perform analyses of LOCA/WRF downscaling simulations for the California Fifth Climate Change Assessment
## Central Coast regional report

These notebooks are designed to faciliate analyses of climate projections generated for the California Fifth Climate Change Assessment. 

All data is hosted on Amazon Web Services, and provided through the Cal-Adapt Analytics Engine:
https://analytics.cal-adapt.org/

Notebooks primarily rely on the downscaling simulations using the LOCA statistical method, but dynamical downscaling from WRF is also available.
